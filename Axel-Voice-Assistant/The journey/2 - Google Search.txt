Flow:

1) Get rid of 'on google', and potentially 'for me'
2) See if the user used 'search up' at start of query, strip 'search/look up', strip that occurence
3) If not, see if user started words with 'search' or 'look', strip that occurence
4) See if user ended query with 'up' (search pokemon up on google), UNLESS 'up' is the only string left (if
user is searching the 2009 critically acclaimed masterpiece, 'UP')
5) IF after all stripping, the search says 'something' (search something up on google for me), Axel prompts
the user for what it wants to search up, otherwise, Axel will search up whatever is left
