Used chatterbot to create some semblance of learning

Axel acts like a dumbbass who can't talk properly, so Axel will memorize things the user
said and its response into memory. Before thinking of a response it will scower its memory
looking to see if it encountered this prompt before and see if it's kinda similar, this
lets me go in and change its responses to some stuff.

Axel has 2 forms of memory: memory (short term), memoryLongTerm (long term). Long term 
memory holds everything Axel has ever been taught, whereas normal memory is capped at 300
and I can play around with it.

Future plans:
- Right now Axel only tests for strings and the corresponding reply, next Axel will test
for strings and what was said before to see if there's a correlation
- Axel creates a user profile it is talking too. It stores it in a .txt file
- The mood of the user is constantly tested (since mood changes). Axel will change certain
responses depending on mood. 
- Use NLTK to learn and actually parse strings. It seems very powerful
