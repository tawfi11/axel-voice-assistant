Make sure you read the INSTRUCTIONS.txt file to see how to install Axel. This txt file
tells you about what I'm looking for and what you can do.

Axel is meant to be my 'Jarvis'. I'm diligently working on him to be able to do a lot of
things an ai assistant can do, but in the meantime I need data of different people talking
to Axel and their conversations.

How this works is there is 2 "versions" of Axel. There is "grande hermano" (big man) Axel,
and "pico nino" (little child) Axel. I have grande hermano Axel, and I am distributing
pico nino Axel to you. pico nino Axel ONLY works as a converation bot, he can't
do anything that grande hermano Axel can, and he's not that good at talking either.

Inside Learning you will see a memoryToSend.txt file, this file has a transcript of any
conversation you have with Axel and his response. I will collect all of these memories from
everyone and train grande hermano Axel with them, then, I will update pico nino Axels using
grande hermano Axel's training. The more data I get the SMARTER he becomes! 

He'll probably talk rubbish to you guys for now, but the MORE you talk to him and the 
more data I get, the smarter Axel will become and the smarter all of your Axels will be.

If you wanna say something to Axel but don't want him to record it, just tell Axel
you wanna tell him a secret. He won't record anything until you say 'end secret'. 

I only need you to send me the memoryToSend.txt file, I'll ask you for it :) you can 
see what Axel remembers abt you before you send it to me. EVERYTHING AXEL STORES IS
LOCAL, SO I DON'T SEE ANYTHING UNTIL YOU SEND ME MEMORYTOSEND.TXT AND EVEN THEN I ONLY
SEE WHAT'S IN THERE (YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF BY OPENING THE MEMORYTOSEND.TXT FILE)

Remember, pico nino axel CAN learn from your convos but he's not very good at it. He'll
probably talk Rubbish. Just ask him random questions or talk normally, even if he spouts
rubbish. He's a reactionary robot so he replies to what you tell him, just say random stuff
and see what he'll say back. I'll use this data to make his responses better and then
I'll add actual conversations where his reply depends on where the conversation has been
going :) 

THANKS A LOT! All of you helping me will def get a copy of Axel when I'm done :) and my
eternal gratitude. I owe you ALL a favor.
