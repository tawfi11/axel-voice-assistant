These are the instructions for using Chatbot. Sorry, but these instructions are pretty long
I'm working on a build that isn't as annoying but for now we gotta work with this. thanks
for doing this for me :)
If you have done steps 1-5 before, skip straight to step 6

1) Download Python (if you don't have it already): https://www.python.org/downloads/ 

2) Run the installer, if it asks you, tick the box that says 'add to environmental vars'
or 'add to PATH'

If you forgot to do that the first time, rerun the python installer, and click modify, and hit 
next until you see a tick box that will ask to add to environmental vars or PATH, tick
that and install

3) Right click the windows symbol on the bottom left and open powershell. Type the following
commands:
pip install chatterbot==1.0.4
[Press enter and wait for that to finish downloading, it'll be done when '>' this shows
up at the end]
pip install pytz

4) This part is very tricky. Make sure you have the script compat.py ready to drag, it's 
inside the AI chatbot folder

Open file explorer, and go to this address:
C:\Users\<Admin>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\Lib\site-packages\sqlalchemy\util
Admin is the main user of the computer. If you wanna check who Admin is, go to:
C->Users and see the folders that has the list of users. Copy the name of the one you think
is the admin user, and paste it into the Admin field up above.

For example, my admin user is named nusai, so the address would be
C:\Users\nusai\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\Lib\site-packages\sqlalchemy\util

Copy that link into the address of your file explorer. Press enter, you should find yourself
in a folder. You'll see a bunch of .py files like init.py, compat.py, etc. We wanna
focus on compat.py. Remember I gave you a copy of compat.py, it's inside the AI Chatbot
folder, drag that compat.py into this one, it'll ask if you wanna replace, say yes

5) Finally, go back to the AI chatbot folder, you should see the script chatbot-test.py, 
and a folder called Learning as well as some other stuff. Open the learning folder and
check memoryToSend.txt, make sure the first time you run this that this is empty. If it isn't
empty just CTRL+A and delete everything, make sure to save

Then in user.txt, replace my name with your name. Keep Name: tho and make sure you don't
add a space between the : and ur name.

For example, if Roy is using this you would have
Name:Roy
This is how Axel will identify you

6) FINALLY FINALLY, get out of the learning folder and go back to just the Ai Chatbot 
folder. While holding left shift, right click the whitespace inside the folder. You'll
see in the options that show up, one of them is 'open windows powershell here'. Click that
and you'll see the powershell appear. Then type the following command:

python chatbot-test.py

And it should open, you'll know it's good when you see your name at the bottom, now you cna
type something and Axel will respond as best as it can, make sure to visit the README.txt
file :)
